###API Version
The resources and operations provided by the API will change over time as new features are added or existing features are modified. In order to maintain compatibility between the API clients and server each version of the API has a designated a version string. This string has to be specified as part of all the requests sent to the server. See Resource URIs for details on how to send the version number.

###Resource URIs

The URIs used by the API have a common base URI followed by the response data format and finally followed by the resource or collection URI.
*For Example,* 
*In http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/api/&lt;api_version&gt;/
&lt;response_format&gt;/tickets/ http://&lt;server&gt;:&lt;port&gt;/api/&lt;api_version&gt;/ is the Base URI &lt;response_format&gt;/ is a response data format like json or yaml or xml tickets/ is the Resource URI*
#####Base URI
The base URI is composed of the following parts
1. HTTPorHTTPSprotocolspecifier2. APIserverhostname3. APIserverportnumber(optionalâ€“defaultstoport80) 4. APIversionstring

###Request Methods

The following HTTP methods are used to perform operations on resources provided by the API.
*NOTE: not all resources support all the listed operations, see the documentation of each resource for the supported methods*
<table>
<tr>
			<td>
				<b>HTTP
				Method</b>
			</td>
			<td>
				<b>Operation</b>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				GET
			</td>
			<td>
				Retrieve a element or list of
				elements
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				POST
			</td>
			<td>
				Create a new element or a child
				entry in a element
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				PUT
			</td>
			<td>
				Update a element
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				DELETE
			</td>
			<td>
				Delete a element
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

###Authentication

The API requires a "API Key" and "Auth Code" pair for access. Contact the Helpdesk Admin for access details.
The server uses HTTP Basic Authentication with the "API Key" as username and "Auth Code" as the password. The authentication realm is "API".
The API server returns HTTP response code 401 in case of authorization required or login failure.
#####SECURITY NOTES:
1. Credentials are passed as plain-text in HTTP Basic Authentication, therefore it isrecommended to use SSL/TLS if the API is used over the Internet.2. It is not recommended to invoke the API directly from browser using Javascript as this would require the "API Key" and "Auth Code" to be present on the browser side. Instead the API should be invoked from the web application server.

###Throttling

The API server limits the number of requests that can be sent during a interval of time. There are independent limits for read and write operations. Contact the Helpdesk Admin to know the current limits and for changing them to meet requirements.
In case the request limits are exceeded the API server returns HTTP response code 503 along with the time to wait before retrying in the response body.

###Request Content Types

The following data formats are supported by the API server when data is sent to it for POST and PUT operations.
Any of the data formats can be used provided the correct Content-Type is set in the HTTP request header.
*NOTE: file uploads are only supported with Multipart Form Data.*
<table><tr>
		<td>
			<b>Request
			Format</b>
		</td>
		<td>
			<b>Content-Type</b>
		</td>
		<td>
			<b>File

		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>

		</td>
		<td>

		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

###Response Content Types

The following data formats are supported for response data sent back by the API server. The required data format is specified as the <response_format> mentioned under Resource URIs.

<table><tr>
			<td>
				<b>Response
				Format</b>
			</td>
			<td>
				<b>Specified
				in URI as</b>
			</td>
			<td>
				<b>Response
				Content-Type</b>
			</td>
		</tr>

			</td>
			<td>
				xml
			</td>
			<td>
				application/xml
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

###Data Types

These are the basic data types that are used in the API. Using these types more complex data structures for the resources are built.

<table><tr>
			<td>
				<b>Type</b>
			</td>
			<td>
				<b>Description</b>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				String
			</td>
			<td>
				String type with Unicode support
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				Integer
			</td>
			<td>
				Signed 64 bit integral number
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				ID
			</td>
			<td>
				Special type of Integer with minimum value 1,
				Will be unique within each resource type
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				Float
			</td>
			<td>
				Floating point number
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				Boolean
			</td>
			<td>
				True/False type
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				DateTime
			</td>
			<td>
				Combined date and
				time in the ISO 8601 extended format of YYYY-MM-DD
				HH:MM:SS.ssssss
				<br/>
				<i><b>NOTES</b>:<br/> 
				
				1. all DateTime values in the API are in UTC
				timezone<br/>
				2. the decimal part represented by ssssss is
				optional<br/>
				3. a space separator is used between the date
				and time values</i>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				Date
			</td>
			<td>
				<a name="firstHeading1"></a>Date in the ISO
				8601 extended format of YYYY-MM-DD<br/>
				<i><b>NOTE</b>: all Date values in the API are in</i>
				UTC timezone
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

###NULL Values

Some of the fields in a resource may be optional or currently absent . The values of these fields are represented as a special NULL value. This value maps to corresponding equivalents in the data formats as listed below.

<table><tr>
			<td>
				<b>Response Format</b>
			</td>
			<td>
				<b>NULL Value Representation</b>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				JSON
			</td>
			<td>
				null
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				YAML
			</td>
			<td>
				null
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				XML
			</td>
			<td>
				Element attribute null="True"
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>

###Paginated Lists for Collection Resources

Some of the collection resources provided by the API may return a large volume of elements. In these cases the API imposes a upper limit on the number elements that can be returned in a single collection read request.
By specifying a page size (lesser than or equal to the upper limit) and a corresponding page number as URL parameters, the collection can be split the into a smaller number of elements and progressively retrieved from the API server.
The response from the API server contains information about the page split and the actual data as described below.
#####URL Parameters

<table><tr>
			<td>
				<b>Field</b>
			</td>
			<td>
				<b>Type</b>
			</td>
			<td>
				<b>Description</b>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>

			</td>
			<td>
				Integer
			</td>
			<td>
				The number of items per page (limited to the
				maximum defined for the particular collection resource)
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				page
			</td>
			<td>
				Integer
			</td>
			<td>
				The number of the page required
			</td>
		</tr>
	</table>
#####Paginated List - Response Data StructureThis data structure contains information and data from the paginated list.

	</table>

###Data Validation Errors

The API server performs validation on the data submitted via POST and PUT requests. In case the data validation fails, the API server returns HTTP response code 400 along with error information in the response body.
The error information response data is a List of Field Errors that contains information about data validation errors in individual fields as well as any errors that apply to the entire request (like errors that are not dependent on individual fields).
#####Field Errors - Response Data Structure
This data structure contains the field name and the list of errors messages for the field.
<table><tr>
			<td>
				<b>Field</b>
			</td>
			<td>
				<b>Type</b>
			</td>
			<td>
				<b>Description</b>
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				field
			</td>
			<td>
				String
			</td>
			<td>
				The name of the field.
				(For errors that pertain to the entire request
				and not to a particular field, the field name will be "__all__")
			</td>
		</tr>
		<tr>
			<td>
				errors
			</td>
			<td>
				List of String
			</td>
			<td>
				One or more errors related to the field value
			</td>
